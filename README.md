## Courses

This repo is a compilation of work from several courses taken in the effort to
gain development experience. Particularly expanding knowledge with React and
Angular2.

### Structure

Each folder seen here holds all of the work from one course. Courses were either
 taken through [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com) or [Coursera](http://www.coursera.com)

Within each course folder there is another ReadMe that explains the course and
how to compile and run each project in the folder.
